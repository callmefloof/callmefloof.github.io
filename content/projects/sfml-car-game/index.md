As part of a C++ programming project, I made a simple clone of Speed Racer in SFML. In prior years lead I had mainly specialized in C# until late 2024 when I decided to switch major from Game Design to Game Development. I had prior experience in C++, but hadn't completed a full project with it up until this point. There was a steep learning curve not relying on the notion of a garbage collector cleaning up after me. This project was a first stepping stone for me in developing games in C++.
